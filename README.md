## About

A simple API built using python made by Bruno Dantas.

This project was used to learn a little about flask and improve my python skills. The idea is to access some pokemon pages and join the informations in a single object.

## Requirements

To run this repository by yourself you will need to install python3 in your machine and them install all the requirements inside the [requirements](requirements.txt) file

## How to use

### Routes

- *'/':* This route gets every pokemon information (actually there are about 900, according the pokemon main page).
- *'/<pokemon_name>':* This route, you need to pass a argument that's the pokemon name that you're looking for.

### Program Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone <https://github.com/DantasB/Pokemon-API>

# Access the project page on your terminal
$ cd Pokemon-API

# Install all the requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file
$ touch .env  

# Create the following parameters
 DEBUG #If the API is on debug mode or not, should be True or False

# Execute the main program
$ python api.py

# Them it's just wait for the code run and access the api local url
```
